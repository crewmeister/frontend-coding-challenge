# ðŸš€ Crewmeister coding challenge - Frontend (React)

Hello and thanks in participating in the crewmeister coding challenge. This coding exercise will help us get a better feeling about your coding process.

If you have any questions, we're happy to help you. Reach the devs at challenge@crewmeister.com.

## Context

At Crewmeister we like to work closely with our clients, listening to their demands and developing solutions for their problems. One of the most requested features is a way for company owners to manage sickness and vacations of employees.

We decided to implement this feature for our clients and we are calling it the Absence Manager.

## Product Requirements

- [ok] I want to see a list of absences including the names of the employees.
- [ok] I want to see the first 10 absences, with the ability to paginate.
- [ok] I want to see a total number of absences.
- [ok] For each absence I want to see:
  - [ok] Member name
  - [ok] Type of absence
  - [ok] Period
  - [ok] Member note (when available)
  - [ok] Status (can be 'Requested', 'Confirmed' or 'Rejected')
  - [ok] Admitter note (when available)
- [ok] I want to filter absences by type.
- [ok] I want to filter absences by date.
- [ok] I want to see a loading state until the list is available.
- [ ] I want to see an error state if the list is unavailable.
- [ok] I want to see an empty state if there are no results.
- [ ] (Bonus) I can generate an iCal file and import it into outlook.

## Your Mission

Create the React application that satisfies all must-have requirements above, plus any nice-to-have requirements you wish to include.

We provided a couple of JSON files with the mock data necessary to implement the screens, you can use the files straight into the frontend or create a small API (bonus), it's your choice.

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer (nextjs, create react app, ...), but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favorite tools and packages to build a solid React application.

You can assume that you do not have to support legacy browsers. Feel free to use modern features such as **fetch** or **flexbox**.

(bonus) Host the website on the service of your choice (Heroku, AWS, GCloud, ...).

Optional: build the project and deploy (ie make it available as a static project) on Github Pages, otherwise please provide detailed instructions on how to start the project locally.

## Tech Requirements

- React
- Tests: Jest + react-testing-library / enzyme
- Code Linter
- Redux is a plus.
- Typescript is a plus.
- CSSinJS is a plus: styled-components, styled-system, ...

## Instructions

- Clone this repo.
- The challenge is on!
- Build a performant, clean and well-structured solution.
- Commit early and often. We want to be able to check your progress.
- Include a README with instructions on how to run your project.
- Please complete your working solution within 7 days of receiving this challenge.
- Whenever you're done please deliver the project following the instructions below.

We'll review your submission as soon as possible. Key-points we're going to review:

- Naming (files, functions, components, ...).
- Tests.
- Code structure, readability, performance and consistency.
- function lengths.
- Commits + commit messages.
- Clean code.
- Good documentation and README instructions.

An essential part of the challenge is also coming up with your own solutions and making reasonable assumptions about the implementation of the acceptance criteria.

## Project delivery instructions

To submit the project for evaluation please follow the steps below:

- Create a **public** repo on your personal Github.
- Add the new repo as a _remote_ on your local repo.
- Push your code to your new remote repo.
- Send us the link! The e-mail is: challenge@crewmeister.com
